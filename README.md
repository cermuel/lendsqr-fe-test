## 🧪 Testing

Unit tests cover both **positive** and **negative** scenarios.

```bash
npm run test
```

Testing tools used:

- **React Testing Library** – for component interaction and rendering
- **Vitest** – for unit test execution and mocking

---

## 💾 Data Handling

- Mock API with 500+ user records generated via [json-generator.com](https://json-generator.com/)

---

## 💡 Design Decisions

- Used **Vite** for fast dev environment and optimized builds
- Chose **Redux** for global state
- Applied **Atomic Design** principles to keep components modular and reusable
- Mobile-first SCSS architecture using variables and mixins for consistency
- Strong **TypeScript** typings for all components and services
